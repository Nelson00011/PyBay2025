## Description:
**[PyBay](https://pybay.org/)** is an annual conference gathering of Pythonistas put on by the [Bay Area Python Association](https://www.bapya.org/). We’re excited to announce that we will be returning in October 2025, to the UCSF Mission Bay Conference Center in San Francisco, CA. This event is 100% community organized. [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf-landing/) is to promote, protect and advance the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language, and to support and faciliate the growth of a diverse and international community of Python Programmers. [PyLadies](https://pyladies.com/) international mentorship group with a focus on helping more women become active participants and leaders in the Python open-source community. 

## Notes:
#### Glyph Lefkowitz | [Glyph](https://www.linkedin.com/in/glyph/) 10:30AM SPEAKER
- **Scaling Open Source UP and Down:** Software isn't finished until the last user is dead. PINPal,
- Medium Projects: Pemodouroboros, DateType, Publication, Automat, Hyperlink...
- Big Project: Twisted, Twisted Org Projects...Baseline Project.

#### Alla Barbalat | [Company](https://www.linkedin.com/in/allabarbalat/) 11:00AM SPEAKER
- **AI, IP, and Your Code: What Developers Need to Know** Interlectual Property (IP) Law, Copyright law implication of AI-generated code. 
- IP has various terms of expiration before becoming public domain: Trademark, Patent, Copyright
- Software Code Licensing: Proprietary, Public Domain, Copyleft, Permissive Open Source. MIT or APACHE license is free and open use of code.
- Market from LLM, COPY right cases for developers different than chemical, biological, or physical patenting.
- Check AI-Generated Code, licensing issues, public code, code evaluation tools for CI/CD.

#### Daniel Hulse | [NASA Ames Research Center](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hulsedaniel/) 11:30AM SPEAKER
- **Architecting Real-World Complex Systems in Python** multidisciplinary physical and cyber-physical interactions (5th [Domain](https://www.cfr.org/book/fifth-domain)) design, integrate, and manage complex systems in various life cycles phases that last for generations compatible with an evolving system over various generations. 
- Simply understanding--let alone designing--complex systems can be tricky. Traditionally, systems engineering approaches have relied on clunky, proprietary, opaque tools to model, analyze, and design system structure and behavior.
- **Model-base Systems Engineering** and **Digitial Twin / Threads**; proprietary software, new information silo, python for engineering analysis. 

#### Brett Slatkin | [Google](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bslatkin/) 11:45AM SPEAKER
- **Do It Yourself: Demystifying the Magic of Dataclasses** Python's built-in `dataclasses` module provides an enormous amount of leverage when defining classes: minimal code can enable maximal capabilities.
- DataClass AWARENESS boilerplate uses for `_init_` (caution for typos), key-only arguments, attribute with a referential default value, string conversion (default behavior), tuple conversion

#### Guido van Rossum | [Microsoft](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guido-van-rossum-4a0756/) 12:30PM / 12:30 SPEAKER
- **Structured RAG is better than RAG!** This is an improvement over the popular AI tactic named RAG (look it up) that can answer questions over large collections of text or images better and faster than RAG.
- Extracts Knowledge: entities (people, places, etc..), actions, topics, relationships, etc... Structure RAG - Query Pipeline.
- Scalable to much larger conservation histories: indexing approach needs less compute and data. Bulk ingestion is slower, due to use of an LLM instead of just embeddings.
- Transcripts, RAG, OpenAI, [typeagent](https://www.piwheels.org/project/typeagent/)
- Example: Albatross [Sea bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albatross)

#### Maggie Moss | [Meta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maggie-moss/) 3:30PM / 16:30 SPEAKER
- **Increasing Types in Large Codebases with Pyrefly and AI Tooling** Meta has some of the largest typed Python codebases in the world. That’s why we built Pyre and now Pyrefly. Despite this, Meta has lots of untyped code and we have been building tooling to help add types at scale.
- Rails Developer, Faster inner loop, Spot typos, better documentation, write code faster (auto-completion)
- Brief History of META Type Checkers; PHP -> Hack, Javascript -> Flow, Python -> [Pyre](https://pyre-check.org/). OCaml was considered.
- [PyCon](https://pycon.org/) lauch, [PYREFLY](https://pyrefly.org/) incredible performance. Type checker is incredibly easy to install, implement and use. Configuration, Silence Errors (pyrefly check --supress-errors, --ignore, --summarize), automatically infers annotations to the code, pairs with open source tools.
- [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro)-PYREFLY; the [Lollipop](https://pypi.org/project/lollipop/) System

#### Pamela Fox | [Microsoft](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pamela-s-fox/)
- **Just because AI can write your tests... should it?** I'm a big fan of AI-assisted coding tools—they’re making programming more accessible than ever! But as developers, we risk using LLMs to write everything, including our tests, and forgetting the powerful tools in our Python testing toolbox.
